        <h1>Scratch game</h1>
        <h3>About scratch</h3>
        <p> Scratch is a programming language used in school for students to learn the basics of coding. And our classmates used Scratch to make our own games. </p>
        <h3>Programing concept</h3>
        <p>The concept of iteration is really special and it makes me really want to master it. It is the repetition of a series of commands. Sounds simple at first, but it is efficient and versatile in term of coding and is wisely used, especially in Scratch like movement. </p>
        <h3>Mygame</h3>
        <p>The game I made is called "Rapid Roll."</p>
        <h3>Obstacle</h3>
        <p>In this game, you will see that every time the ball falls to the platform, it sticks with it. At first, as the flatform goes down, the ball keeps bouncing (which violates Newton's law of gravitation), and also it's hard for player to have a base to jump up.</p>
        <h3>Favorite aspects of this game</h3>
        <p>This game is a remake of "Rapid Roll" on the "legendary brick" phone Nokia 1280. It was my first phone so I tried to make this game to show my appreciation. </p>
        <h3>Improvement</h3>
        <p>I changed my idea of making this game lately at very last moment because I failed to create my initial idea. If more time was given, I would add to hardness of the game over time and improve the graphics quality. </p>
        <h3>Game descripption</h3>
        <p>You are a ball which has to survive as long as possible dropping down from platform to platform, deviating from barriers spikes!</p>
        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p>Just left and right arrow keys and you will figure it out.</p>
