          <h3>Story Synopsis:</h3>
          <p>As an addicted gambler, Goofy is in trouble with  debt. Bank robery seems to be the only choice to save him from the debt settlement. Let's help  this poor guy decide.</p>
          <h3>Applied  programming concepts or structures:</h3>
          <p>Loops were quite challenging to get them right. In my story,  I used "while function" to  have the reader enter the correct answer, else it would keep repeating the request forever. </p>
          <h3>Interesting story from classmates</h3>
        <p>I remember there was a story about the fight betweeen avocado and toothpick. It was simple, but really funny and creative.</p>
